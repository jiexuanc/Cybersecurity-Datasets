# Cybersecurity-Datasets
Overview:

Collection of cybersecurity datasets for intrusion detection, separated by the type of data (network, event logs, verbose):

Network (i.e. PCAPs, DNS)

Event Logs 
---
- [DARPA OpTC](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/operationally-transparent-cyber-optc) -- 18B events (~300 GB zipped)
    - Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03080
    - Alternative link for individual logs: https://github.com/FiveDirections/OpTC-data
    - The experiment testbed consisted of 1000 hosts with Windows 10 operating system. Dataset contains benign, evaluation and short folders
        - Benign stores the normal activity captured
        - Evaluation stores event captured during the red team activity period
        - Short contains events that were captured but is missing values

- [Unified Host and Network Data Set (LANL 2018)](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/2017)
    - The host event logs originated from most enterprise computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system on Los Alamos National Laboratoryâ€™s (LANL) enterprise network. The network event data originated from many of the internal enterprise routers within the LANL enterprise network.
    - Does not have any documented red team activities which severely compromises its utility in advanced persistent threat detection

- [Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events (LANL 2015)](https://csr.lanl.gov/data/cyber1/)
    - The data sources include Windows-based authentication events from both individual computers and centralized Active Directory domain controller servers; process start and stop events from individual Windows computers; Domain Name Service (DNS) lookups as collected on internal DNS servers; network flow data as collected on at several key router locations; and a set of well-defined red teaming events that present bad behavior within the 58 days.
    - Only tags login events with nominal red team labeling

- [Malicious Behavior Detection using Windows Audit Logs](https://github.com/konstantinberlin/malware-windows-audit-log-detection)
    - Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04200.pdf
    - Extensive anonymization of dataset
- Indicator of compromise (IOCs)
    - [EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack](https://github.com/mdecrevoisier/EVTX-to-MITRE-Attack)
    - [EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES](https://github.com/sbousseaden/EVTX-ATTACK-SAMPLES)
    - [Security-Datasets](https://github.com/OTRF/Security-Datasets)

Note that many event logs datasets also contain network data

Verbose
---
- [Loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub)
    - Supercomputers (BGL and Thunderbird)
    - Hadoop distributed file system log
- Common crawl is a possible option if looking for random application logs (But cannot expect any form of labelled data)

Require Access

- [UNSW-NB15](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset)
- [Four Labeled Datasets to Enable Reproducible Cyber Research](https://cybervan.peratonlabs.com:9000/milcom-2016-data-sets)
- [What Supercomputers Say: A Study of Five System Logs](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-Supercomputers-Say%3A-A-Study-of-Five-System-Oliner-Stearley/01b5c01835a57f63c250b4eed923b7f736707624)

Observations:
Network files and verbose logs are plentiful.
Event logs not so much...

Issues faced
---

Challenges faced acquiring host log data are best described by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.07847.pdf)
- Required for the application of SIGMA detection rules, and that these data to be sufficiently detailed
- Collection in a production network with real users provide realistic data but confidentiality and privacy issue forbid the publication of these data
    - OS (Windows/MacOS/Linux) logs are usually not publicly available
    - Even publicly available logs have extensive anonymization and are of little use (Refer to Windows Audit Log)
- Rely on dedicated lab testbeds for log data acquisition
    - Does not capture real enterprise usage
    - Less focus on benign cases
- End result is that researchers often create their own testbed or work with enterprises for their host log data generation
- DARPA OpTC and LANL 2018 allievate some of the issues...

Interesting stuff

[SSADLog: Whole Lifecycle Tuning Anomaly Detection with Small Sample Logs](https://github.com/NickZhouSZ/SSADLog)
- SSADLog introduces a hyper-efficient log data pre-processing method that generates a representative subset of small sample logs. It leverages a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) language model to create contextual word embeddings. Furthermore, a semi-supervised fine-tuning process is employed for enhancing detection accuracy. A distinctive feature of SSADLog is its ability to fine-tune language models with small samples, achieving high-performance iterations in just approximately 30 minutes.
- During training phase, queue based eliminating duplication for initial training, then PLHF + Tuning purposed balancing = Fine Tuning Log Messages for fine tuning
- During operations, same finetuning process is done without initial training (This is quite mysterious as during operations, log messages wouldn't normally be labelled)
- Dataset used: BGL and Thunderbird (Both present in Loghub and labelled), Spirit1G (require access), real-world dataset (Not disclosed)
